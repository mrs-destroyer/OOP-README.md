# Changing class members
Class members can be used with the cls keyword. The cls keyword is similar to the self keyword but unlike the self keyword, it represents the class itself. Class variables can be declared in the class outside the methods without using any keyword.

# Constructors in Python
Constructor is a special function that gets automatically called when an object of class is created.

# Destructors in Python
A destructor are like a function, used to destroy and clean up object after it has been created and initialised. Python has a trash collector which automatically handles the memory management So destructor are not much needed in python.

# First class function
Firat class object in a language are handled uniformly throughout. They may be stored in data structures, passed as arguments, or used in control structures. Programming language is said to support first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class object.

# Metaprogramming with metaclasses
Metaclass is used for creating Classes, and these classes can create the objects. The metaclass is responsible for creating the classes so the user can write their customized metaclasses by inserting code or extra actions for modifying the way classes are created.

# Class and instance attribute
Python class attributes are variables of a class that are shared between all of its instances. They differ from instance attributes in that instance attributes are owned by one specific instance of the class and are not shared between instances.

# Reflection
A python script can find out about the type , class , attributes and methods of an object. This is referred to as reflection or introspection.

# Garbage collection
When a value in memory is no longer referenced by a variable, the python interpreter automatically removes it from memory. The process is known as garbage collection.
